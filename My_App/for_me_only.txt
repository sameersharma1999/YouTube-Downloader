###################   About call back function  ###############

here we apply a callback function on the YouTube() function ... to get the url ...
as we know the first argument of the function is url of the youtube video that we need,
and second argument we can apply the callback function....

we can call that callback function either at every chunk we receive....
for that we have to use on_progress_callback as a keyword then apply a function to it
and that function will run for every chunk we get (see example given below)
YouTube(my_url, on_progress_callback=my_callback_function)

or at the end of all the chunks we receive...
for that we have to use on_complete_callback as a keyword then apply a function to it
and that function will run after we receive every chunk (see example given below)
YouTube(my_url, on_complete_callback=my_callback_function)

Here we will talk about at every chunk we receive...........

Before that... What is chunk?
   a chunk is set of data in bits/bytes that we receive, we receive the data in chunks we can check the size of chunk(idk how, but u can....google it out)

now... 
At definition of our callback function will be having 5 arguments ie. self, stream, chunk, file_handle, bytes_remaining
(actually these values u got when u get the url when u run YouTube() function)
therfore u need to receive these 5 values .......

first is self (u know it already)
second is stream (u know this also already)
third is chunk (chunk is data in bits/bytes)
fourth if file_handle (path where file will be downloaded)
bytes_remaning (number of bytes that are remaining to download)
